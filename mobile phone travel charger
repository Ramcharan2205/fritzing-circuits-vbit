mobile phone travel charger
Here is an ideal Mobile charger using 1.5 volt pen cells to charge mobile phone while traveling. It can replenish cell phone battery three or four times in places where AC power is not available. Most of the Mobile phone batteries are rated at 3.6 V/500 mA. A single pen torch cell can provide 1.5 volts and 1.5 Amps current. So if four pen cells are connected serially, it will form a battery pack with 6 volt and 1.5 Amps current. When power is applied to the circuit through S1, transistor Q1 conducts and Green LED lights.

When Q1 conducts Q2 also conducts since its base becomes negative. Charging current flows from the collector of Q1. To reduce the charging voltage to 4.7 volts, Zener diode D2 is used. The output gives 20 mA current for slow charging. If more current is required for fast charging, reduce the value of R4 to 47 ohms so that 80 mA current will be available. Output points are used to connect the charger with the mobile phone. Use suitable pins for this and connect with correct polarity. The circuit comes from here.
